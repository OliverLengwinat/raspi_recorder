recording sound on a Raspberry Pi using a webcam and Python scripts

Living with someone who talks in their sleep can be very funny. Sometimes it's nonsensical mumbling, sometimes it's surprising words or even whole sentences. 

However, they themselves are unfortunately the only ones who can never hear what they said. 
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to record these events? And to record only when things are being said and not during the boring rest of the night?
I've created a Python script for a Raspberry Pi that can do just that. You can use any USB-microphone that you might already have, or a cheap USB-soundcard with a headset or a standard USB webcam.
